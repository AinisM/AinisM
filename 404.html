  <h3 style="text-align:center;">Photography is a Powerful Weapon</h3>
  <p>To take a good photograph, a person doesnâ€™t need to put much effort. He or she only has to find the perfect light, background and add a little creativity. But depending on a target audience, you will need to take into account some more aspects. For some people, the shooting time or locations would be enough to make a conclusion on the photograph. To sum up, different people see the photographs in different ways.

Very often, a photograph is a powerful weapon to influence groups of people. As mentioned previously, you do not always know the truth behind a photograph. Therefore, many photographers take the use of it to control the vulnerable people. In addition, people with different ideologies interpret images in their own ways and sometimes may not understand the meaning well. For instance, if you want to grab attention from particular people, you can try to make the image cause shock, aggression, sadness, stress, or uncertainty. Such incidences have already happened more than once in the real world, and especially during the Lebanon war period. This is a warning to all people to be careful and unbiased when viewing photos and videos in the media.</p>
